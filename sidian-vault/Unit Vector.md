# Finding Magnitude/Length of a Vector
Given vector
$$
\vec{a} = (2, 3)
$$

We can infer that it composes of going to the right by `2` and then going up by `3` so how do we find the magnitude of the vector?
```
Magnitude is basically how long a vector is.
```
The magnitude of a vector can be found by using this formula:
$$
||\vec{a}|| = \sqrt{\vec{a}^2}
$$
$$
\vec{a}^2 = x^2 + y^2
$$
Or if given the previous example of vector a it would be like this
$$
||\vec{a}|| = \sqrt{2^2 + 3^2} = 3.60
$$

# Unit Vector
Unit vector is a vector that has a magnitude of 1 to obtain a unit vector of any arbitrary vector we can use this formula; Unit Vector is denoted by adding `^`(Hat/Cap) to a variable.
$$
\hat{a} = \frac{\vec{a}}{||\vec{a}||}
$$
||a|| = Magnitude of vector a
